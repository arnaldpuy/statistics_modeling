# Should statistics rescue mathematical modeling?

Andrea Saltelli and Arnald Puy

This is the ``R`` code to reproduce the figures of the paper, whose abstract reads as follows:

*Statistics experiences a storm around the perceived misuse and possible abuse of its methods in the context of the so-called reproducibility crisis that has made headlines. Mathematical modelling is not following a similar trajectory. Since mathematical modelling is not a discipline like statistics, its shortcomings risk remaining untreated longer. We suggest that the tools of statistics and its disciplinary organisation might offer a remedial contribution to mathematical modelling, standardising methodologies and disseminating good practices. A step in the proposed direction is offered here by focusing on the use of statistical tools for quality assurance of mathematical models.*
